# Abstract Inventory

Abstract Inventory was a concept that was inspired by 
Miguel Grinberg's Flask App tutorial: 
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

I decided to create my own rendition of the project by
adding an administrator console, removing the blogs/posts, and create a template for an IT infrastructure to 
use a database system for tracking inventory.

I wanted to make something that could be easily
customizable to fit an IT infrastructure's needs.

## Installation

To use this inventory system, I would first use a
terminal emulator to install the necessary packages
to get it up and running:

Use the package manager called [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
to install the necessary modules from the requirements.txt file

Activate your virtual environment and then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, you can login into the inventory system
using the following credentials:

Username: admin

Password: password
